# Brain Games

Brain Games is a collection of five console-based cognitive training games inspired by popular mobile brain-training applications.

## Overview

- Each game presents a series of questions that challenge different cognitive skills.
- Players must provide correct answers to progress.
- Successfully answering three questions in a row completes the game.
- An incorrect answer ends the current session, prompting the player to start over.

These games are designed to exercise your mind and improve cognitive abilities through engaging, quick-fire challenges.

## Installation

To set up the Brain Games project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/nmdcat/fullstack-javascript-project-44.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd fullstack-javascript-project-44
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```

   ```

4. Link the package to use game commands globally:
   ```
   npm link
   ```

After completing these steps, you should be able to run any of the games using their respective commands (e.g., `brain-calc`, `brain-progression`, etc.) from anywhere in your terminal.
